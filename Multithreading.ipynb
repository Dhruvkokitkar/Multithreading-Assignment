    "1 What is multithreading in python? hy is it used? Name the module used to handle threads in python?\n",
    "Multithreading is a threading technique in Python programming to run multiple threads concurrently by rapidly switching between threads \n",
    "with a CPU help (called context switching).\n",
    "Python multithreading enables efficient utilization of the resources as the threads share the data space and memory. Multithreading in Python allows the concurrent and parallel occurrence of various tasks. It causes a reduction in time consumption or response time, thereby increasing the performance.\n",
    "The threading module is a high-level implementation of multithreading used to deploy an application in Python. To use multithreading, we need to import the threading module in Python Program. A start() method is used to initiate the activity of a thread"

    "Threads allows a program to operate more efficiently by doing multiple things at the same time. Threads can be used to perform complicated tasks in the background without interrupting the main program.\n",
